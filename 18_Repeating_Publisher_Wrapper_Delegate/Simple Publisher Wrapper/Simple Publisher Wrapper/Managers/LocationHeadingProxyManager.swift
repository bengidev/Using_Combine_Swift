/// 1. CLLocationManager is the heart of what is being wrapped, part of CoreLocation. Because it has additional methods
///     that need to be called for using the framework, I exposed it as a public read-only property.
///     This is useful for requesting user permission to use the location API,
///     which the framework exposes as a method on CLLocationManager.
/// 2. A private instance of PassthroughSubject with the data type we want to publish
///     provides our inside-the-class access to forward data.
/// 3. A public property publisher exposes the publisher from that subject for external subscriptions.
/// 4. The heart of this works by assigning this class as the delegate to the CLLocationManager instance,
///     which is set up at the tail end of initialization.
/// 5. The CoreLocation API doesnâ€™t immediately start sending information. There are methods that need to be called
///     to start (and stop) the data flow, and these are wrapped and exposed on this proxy object. Most publishers are
///     set up to subscribe and drive consumption based on subscription, so this is a bit out of the norm
///     for how a publisher starts generating data.
/// 6. With the delegate defined and the CLLocationManager activated, the data will be provided via callbacks
///     defined on the CLLocationManagerDelegate. We implement the callbacks we want for this wrapped object,
///     and within them we use passthroughSubject .send() to forward the information to any existing subscribers.
/// 7. While not strictly required, the delegate provided an Error reporting callback, so we included that as an example
///     of forwarding an error through passthroughSubject.
///
