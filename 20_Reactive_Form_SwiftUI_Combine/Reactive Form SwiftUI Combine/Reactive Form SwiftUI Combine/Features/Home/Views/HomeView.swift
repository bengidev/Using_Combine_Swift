/// 1. The model is exposed to SwiftUI using @ObservedObject.
/// 2. @State buttonIsDisabled is declared locally to this view, with a default value of true.
/// 3. The projected value from the property wrapper ($model.firstEntry and $model.secondEntry)
///     are used to pass a Binding to the TextField view element. The Binding will trigger updates
///     back on the reference model when the user changes a value, and will let SwiftUIâ€™s components
///     know that changes are about to happen if the exposed model is changing.
/// 4. The validation messages, which are generated and assigned within the model is invisible
///     to SwiftUI here as a combine publisher pipeline. Instead this only reacts to the model changes 
///     being exposed by those values changing, irregardless of what mechanism changed them.
/// 5. As an example of how to use a published with onReceive, an onReceive subscriber is used to listen
///     to a publisher which is exposed from the model reference. In this case, we take the value and
///     store is locally as @State within the SwiftUI view, but it could also be used after
///     some transformation if that logic were more relevant to just the view display of the resulting values.
///     In this case, we use it with disabled on Button to enable or disable that UI element based on
///     the value stored in the @State.
