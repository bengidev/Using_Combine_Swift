/// 1. The TestablePublisher lets you set up a publisher that returns specific values at specific times.
///     In this case, itâ€™s returning 3 items at consistent intervals.
/// 2. When you use the virtual time scheduler, it is important to make sure to invoke it with start.
///     This runs the virtual time scheduler, which can run faster than a clock since it only needs
///     to increment the virtual time and not wait for elapsed time.
/// 3. results is a TestableSubscriber object, and includes a recordedOutput property which provides 
///     an ordered list of all the data and combine control path interactions with their timing.
